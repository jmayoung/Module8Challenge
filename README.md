## Module 8 Challenge

## Description
This is an application used to store or add new vehicles to a vehicle database, and then choose what actions you'd like to do with the vehicles. There was a source code provided for this application, but several modifications were made to include truck and motorbike vehicle types. The truck and motorbike vehicle types have special actions that only they can do, where the truck can tow other vehicles, and the motorbike can perform a wheelie. Some vehicles were automatically added to the Vehicle array, but others can be included.
Full demonstration of the application can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jG8AF_By4xCsVd4m-pFjdHjJhmnhOoN0/view

  ## Contributing
  Github user jmayoung was the main contributor to the code provided by DU Coding Bootcamp through GitLab. Assistance in code writing was requested from the instructor of the course, Karina as well as some assistance from the courses's AI portal.


  ## Tests
  Try out putting in or selecting different vehicle types. If a car or motorbike is selected, they will not be able to perform the towing action. If a car or truck is selected, they will not be able to perform a wheelie. Adititonally, only the motorbike vehicle type will ask questions about front and rear wheel diameter as well as brands.
